> A personal website of mine serving as a portfolio and a link collection for all of my social media accounts (*just like carrd.co/linktr.ee*).

We all know that there are many benefits to having your own portfolio/personal website. For a long time, I have procrastinated on creating one for myself, and instead used social media to post my work and establish an online presence. I think it's necessary for anybody looking into web development to have a personal website.

## Built with
**Tech used**: Astro, SCSS, Svelte components, Bun

This is my first project utilizing a JavaScript framework. I'm a fan of simplicity and I have always just stuck to using a Python backend serving Jinja2 templates. The reason I chose Astro for this project is its speed, appealing DX, modern features and usage of [`.astro` components][astro components].  
The [`origin/python-based` branch][python branch] is an older abandoned attempt of creating this website using the [FastAPI][fastapi] framework, SCSS and [JinjaX][jinjax] for templating.

## Quickstart
TODO

## Not written by AI
Love it or hate it, AI tooling is nowadays incredibly widespread.  
While I'm not a fan of AI code completion tools, I found myself using chatbots to generate ideas (*commit names, summaries, function names, etc.*), which resulted in me developing a bad habit of picking the easy way out whenever I'm stuck with an issue instead of actually trying to find the answer manually, which is a bad practice. While AI can speed up work, It kills creativity.  
I have challenged myself to refrain from <u>any</u> AI usage in writing this project.
