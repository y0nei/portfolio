> A personal website of mine serving as a portfolio and a link collection for all of my social media accounts (*just like carrd.co/linktr.ee*).

We all know that there are many benefits to having your own portfolio/personal website. For a long time, I have procrastinated on creating one for myself, and instead used social media to establish an online presence and post my work. I believe it's necessary for anybody looking into web development to have a personal website, creating your own portfolio site — rather than working within the limitations of other platforms — showcases your dedication to your craft. With your own site, you can integrate design features tailored exclusively to your style and capabilities.
Speaking of design, I decided to take time and learn Figma in order to create a prototype of this website, not only to train myself as a web developer, but also as a designer.

## Built with
**Tech used**: Astro, SCSS, Svelte components, Bun

This is my first project utilizing a JavaScript framework. I'm a fan of simplicity and I have always just stuck to using a Python backend serving Jinja2 templates. The reason I chose Astro for this project is its speed, appealing DX, modern features and usage of [`.astro` components][astro components].  
The [`origin/python-based` branch][python branch] is an older abandoned attempt of creating this website using the [FastAPI][fastapi] framework, SCSS and [JinjaX][jinjax] for templating.

## Quickstart
TODO

## Not written by AI
Love it or hate it, AI tooling is nowadays incredibly widespread.  
While I'm not a fan of AI code completion tools, I found myself using chatbots to generate ideas (*commit names, summaries, function names, etc.*), which resulted in me developing a bad habit of picking the easy way out whenever I'm stuck with an issue instead of actually trying to find the answer manually, which is a bad practice. While AI can speed up work, It kills creativity.  
I have challenged myself to refrain from <u>any</u> AI usage during the development of this project.
